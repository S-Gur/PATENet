PATENet: Pairwise Alignment of Time Evolving Networks
==

Overview
-------
`PATENet` finds the best local alignment between two [temporal] sequences of objects 
(e.g. ordered sequences of networks) based on provided similarity measure between the 
objects comprising the sequences (e.g. networks), a monotone transform function, and 
an object-match threshold.

This is a python implementation of **PATENet** as described in

> Gur, S., & Honavar, V. G. (2018, July). **PATENet: Pairwise Alignment of Time Evolving 
> Networks**. In _International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining in Pattern 
> Recognition_ (pp. 85-98). Springer, Cham.

Please cite this paper if you use this code.


This implementation requires `python>=3.6`.
